    h5.mt-4 Objectives of vaccination
    p COVID-19 vaccination is primarily aimed at reducing COVID-19 hospital admissions and deaths among people who are most at risk.
    p Vaccination should also help maintain health and social services activities and a return to a normal life as soon as possible.
    p Numerous studies carried out in Qu√©bec and elsewhere have shown that vaccination is highly effective in preventing COVID-19, hospital admissions and deaths both after the first dose and after 2 doses.
    p Studies are underway to determine whether people who have been vaccinated no longer spread the infection and whether the usual protective measures (physical distancing, wearing a mask and handwashing) can be relaxed.
